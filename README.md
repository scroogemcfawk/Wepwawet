## This program updates the stock prices in the MS Excel sheet.

It is a remake to my previous Python 🐍 script that used to do the same thing, 
which I wrote for my mom, cuz she trades stocks 💹 and it's so painful to see her do it manually 😔, 
but this time I will write it in Java ☕ using concurrency 💀 so it's gonna be fast as fawk boi.
